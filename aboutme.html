<p>Hi! I am a rising junior at High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies on the Lower East Side. I am very interested in learning how to code and even becoming a professional coder. Therefore, I joined Girls Who Code.</p>

<p>I take a lot of pride in all of my work and honestly having support is the best thing . I believe in myself and having other people believe in me is nice too.

<p>My first experience with robotics was great. I thought robotics was something nerdy but, BOY WAS I WRONG!!! I found a lot of positive and interesting things in robotics. It's fun, too. The idea of robotics taking over the world scares and makes me nervous. However, I am excited for the future in robotics because I feel like robotics is going to be important in the near but also distant future. I enjoyed working on the circuits because we basically got through it using trial and error.
